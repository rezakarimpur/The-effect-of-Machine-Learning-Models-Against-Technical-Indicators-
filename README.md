This repository contains the codebase developed as part of a postgraduate research project titled:
"The Effectiveness of Machine Learning Models Against Technical Indicators and the Buy-and-Hold Strategy on Portfolio Analysis."

The research compared two machine learning models, Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks, against traditional strategies like MACD, EMA, RSI, and Buy-and-Hold. The models were trained and tested using minute-level data from the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), with a focus on real-world constraints such as trading turnover limits and risk-adjusted performance metrics.

***** Key Features
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Technical Indicator Calculation (SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands)

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Regressor, Deep Neural Network (DANN)

Trading Signal Generation (Buy / Sell / Hold logic)

Portfolio Backtesting with Sharpe, Sortino, and Drawdown Metrics

Risk-Reward Ratio Evaluation (STAR, MiniMax, Gini, Distortion RRR)

*****Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

Keras / TensorFlow

TA-lib (for technical indicators, if applicable)
